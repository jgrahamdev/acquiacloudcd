/**
 * @file
 * Entity Browser view mode for Entity Galleries.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - entity_gallery: The entity gallery entity with limited access to object
 *   properties and methods. Only method names starting with "get", "has", or
 *   "is" and a few common methods such as "id", "label", and "bundle" are
 *   available. For example:
 *   - entity_gallery.getCreatedTime() will return the entity gallery creation
 *     timestamp.
 *   - entity_gallery.hasField('field_example') returns TRUE if the entity
 *     gallery bundle includes field_example. (This does not indicate the
 *     presence of a value in this field.)
 *   - entity_gallery.isPublished() will return whether the entity gallery is
 *     published or not.
 *   Calling other methods, such as entity_gallery.delete(), will result in an
 *   exception.
 *   See \Drupal\entity_gallery\Entity\EntityGallery for a full list of public
 *   properties and
 *   methods for the entity gallery object.
 * - label: The title of the entity gallery.
 * - content: All entity gallery items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - author_picture: The entity gallery author user entity, rendered using the
 *   "compact" view mode.
 * - metadata: Metadata for this entity gallery.
 * - date: Themed creation date field.
 * - author_name: Themed author name field.
 * - url: Direct URL of the current entity gallery.
 * - display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - entity-gallery: The current template type (also known as a "theming
 *     hook").
 *   - entity-gallery--type-[type]: The current entity gallery type. For
 *     example, if the entity gallery is an "Article" it would result in
 *     "entity-gallery--type-article". Note that the machine name will often be
 *     in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - entity-gallery--view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the entity
 *     gallery; for example, a teaser would result in:
 *     "entity-gallery--view-mode-teaser", and full:
 *     "entity-gallery--view-mode-full".
 *   The following are controlled through the entity gallery publishing options.
 *   - entity-gallery--unpublished: Appears on unpublished entity galleries
 *     visible only to site admins.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - content_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main
 *   content tag that appears in the template.
 * - author_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the author of
 *   the entity gallery tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   entity gallery cannot hold the main body content.
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
