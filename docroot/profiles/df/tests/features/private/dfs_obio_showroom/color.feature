Feature: DFS OBIO Showroom: Color
  In order to prove that the OBIO theme is recolorable.
  As a developer
  I need to check for page elements.

#  @api @javascript
#  Scenario: Color: Recolorable
#    Given I am logged in as a user with the administrator role
#    And I visit "/admin/appearance/settings/obio"
#    Then I should see "Color scheme"
#    And I should see a "Color set" field
#    When I click the "#color_scheme_form .color-palette [data-activates]" element
#    When I click the "span:contains('Obio brown')" element
#    And I press "Save configuration"
#    And I am on the homepage
#    Then I should see the ".field-name-field-hero-link a" element with the color "rgb(203, 127, 52)"
#    When I visit "/admin/appearance/settings/obio"
#    When I click the "#color_scheme_form .color-palette [data-activates]" element
#    When I click the "span:contains('Obio (default)')" element
#    And I press "Save configuration"
#    And I am on the homepage
#    Then I should see the ".field-name-field-hero-link a" element with the color "rgb(51, 102, 204)"
